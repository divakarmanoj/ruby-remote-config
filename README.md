## Contributing to ruby-remote-config
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to ensure someone hasn't requested and/or contributed to it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't unintentionally break it in a future version.
* Please avoid messing with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
